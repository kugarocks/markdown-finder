# Markdown Finder

> Forked from [maaslalani/nap](https://github.com/maaslalani/nap) which is a code snippet manager for your terminal.

Markdown finder is a tool focused on quickly locating code snippets within Markdown files.
You can use `---` to divide different sections of a Markdown file,
allowing you to quickly copy the code within each section.
